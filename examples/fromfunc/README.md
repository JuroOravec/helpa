# Component from function example

This example is the same as [the Basic example](./../basic/README.md).
But in this one, we use the `Render` method to generate the parsed struct.

You can define Helpa components from inlined texts, files, or functions.

Moreover, in this example you can see how to work with templates that
define multiple documents (e.g. YAML files that use document separator `---`).
